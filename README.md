# Grad-TTS

Official implementation of the Grad-TTS model based on Diffusion Probabilistic Modelling. For all details check out our paper accepted to ICML 2021 via [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06337) link.

## Abstract

## Installation

Firstly, install all Python package requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Secondly, build `monotonic_align` code (Cython):

```bash
cd model/monotonic_align; python setup.py build_ext --inplace; cd ../..
```

**Note**: code is tested on Python==3.8.0.

## Inference

1. Create text file with sentences you want to synthesize like `resources/filelists/synthesis.txt`.
2. For single speaker set `params.n_spks=1` and for multispeaker (Libri-TTS) inference set `params.n_spks=247`.
3. Run script `inference.py` by providing path to the text file, path to the Grad-TTS checkpoint, number of iterations to be used for reverse diffusion (default: 10) and speaker id if you want to perform multispeaker inference:
    ```bash
    python inference.py -f <your-text-file> -c <grad-tts-checkpoint> -t <number-of-timesteps> -s <speaker-id-if-multispeaker>
    ```
4. Check out folder called `out` for generated audios.

You can also perform *interactive inference* by running Jupyter Notebook `inference.ipynb` or by using our [Google Colab Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YNrXtkJQKcYDmIYJeyX8s5eXxB4zgpZI?usp=sharing).

## Training

1. Make filelists of your audio data like ones included into `resources/filelists` folder. For single speaker training refer to `jspeech` filelists and to `libri-tts` filelists for multispeaker.
2. Set experiment configuration in `params.py` file.
3. Specify your GPU device and run training script:
    ```bash
    export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=YOUR_GPU_ID
    python train.py  # if single speaker
    python train_multi_speaker.py  # if multispeaker
    ```
4. To track your training process run tensorboard server on any available port:
    ```bash
    tensorboard --logdir=YOUR_LOG_DIR --port=8888
    ```
    During training all logging information and checkpoints are stored in `YOUR_LOG_DIR`, which you can specify in `params.py` before training.
